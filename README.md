Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to develop 
and maintain high quality systems.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
These milestones are the events or developments that have brought software engineering to the structured and organised stage where it is now.
They are :
1.The stage of the structured programming.This was during the 1960s and 1970s.Clear,logical structures in codes were introduced during this era.
2.The rise of Object-Oriented programming:This programming method that was birthed in the 80s introduced the conceptof objects which are self contained units of code that represent real world entities.
The Agile Methodologies era::This era that started in the 2000s transformed software  engineering and project management because it emphasised ratpid iteration and flexibility,amongst others.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The stages are 
:
1.Planning:This is where the project's scope,objectives and feasibility are determined.The needs/requirements of the projects are also analyzed too.
2.Design:This is where the architecture and detailed design of the project is undertaken.
3.Coding:This is where the software takes shape as the developer writes te actual code,based on the design from the previous stage.
4:Testing:The software is tested for errors,bugs and/or issues.This is to find out if it meets the requirements.
5.Deployment:The software is released for use.
6.Maintenance:This is the stage where it is monitored and maintained,if need be.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In simple terms,waterfall is like following a strict recipe from start to finish,while Agile is like cooking,tasting and adjusting until the desired meal is gotten.
The Waterfall method is Predictable,rigid and sequential-one predefined step after the other;while the agile methodology is iterative,very flexible,adaptive  and more collaborative in nature.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer focuses on writing and maintaining the code,while the QA engineer ensures the software works correctly by testing it.The Project manager overaseas the entire project,ensuring that everything is completed on schedule and according to the required and set standards.

There roles are:
1. Software developer:codes,design,debug,document,test the code and collaborate with others on the project team.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests,documents,ensures quality control and collaborates with other members of the project team.
3. Project Manager:Plans,coordinates,communicates,manages risk and resources and ensures quality assurance for the finished product.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
I will do my research and find out more about this.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face these common challenges:
1.Complex problem solving:complexities in architectures,algorithms and systems can pose a problem.The best stragies to handle this challenge is to break them into smaller units,use design patterns and stay updated by learning.
2.Keeping up with rapidly changing technology:Things change fast in the tech landscape,so the engineer should not stop learning.He should be involved with a community of peers too,to always get updates.
3.Time management and meeting deadlines:Hecan use prioritization,agile practices and avoidance of multitasking should be used for tackling this challenge.
4:Collaborating in teams:Clear communication and code reviews should be prioritized,to handle this challenge.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing involves testing individual components in Isolation.This ensures that each unit is functional.
2. Integration testing:This is the testing of the interactions between different units of the software.
3. System Testing:This tets the complete and integrated software.Its purpose is to check the end to end functionality of the software.
4. Acceptance testing:This is the last test before the software is delivere to the client or end users.The goal of this testing is to ensure that the software meets the agreed needs or requirements.
   

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering refers to the processof designng and refining prompts to achieve more accurate,relevant and effective responses from AI models.It is simply the art of crafting and dropping the best prompts as requests to the AI model,so as to get the most accurate answers.It also ensures efficient interaction,enhanced control and mitigating bias and errors.

Prompt engineering is a critical skill for anyone looking to effectivelyharness AI's capabilities.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Tell me about History."

Improved prompt: "Provide a brief overview of the key events in Benin history during the 19th century"
